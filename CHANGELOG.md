# 6.0.YYYYMMDD
##### 2021-Jun-24
* Bump to location-conflation v1.0.2 / country-coder v5.0.3
* ⚠️  Replace rollup/parcel/babel with [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) for super fast build speed. Package exports are now:
  * `"module": "./index.mjs"` - ESM, modern JavaScript, works with `import`
  * `"main": "./dist/javascript/nsi.cjs"` - CJS bundle, modern JavaScript, works with `require()`
  * `Matcher()` is a class now.  Instantiate it like: `matcher = new Matcher();`
  * No longer distributing ES5 builds
* ⚠️  name-suggestion-index is marked as `"type": "module"` now
* ⚠️  Dropped support for old browsers like Internet Explorer on https://nsi.guide
